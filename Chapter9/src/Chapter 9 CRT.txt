The index value of the third element in an array is 2.


2. 

int quantities[] = new int [19]

double heights[] = {1.65, 2.15, 4.95}

for (int  integer: grades)
{
System.out.println(integer);
}

 a)
 
Int data = 4;
Int[] tester = new int[4]
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
tester[i] = tester[i] +1;
}
tester[0] = data;


b) 


Int data = 4;
Int[] tester = new int[4]
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
tester[i] = tester[i + 1];
}
tester[0] = data;




6. 
When passing the whole array you have to write it with curly brackets ( { } ) to indicate that there is more than one item. When you pass the whole array you have to separate the different items using a comma. 
In a single element array you only have to use the square brackets ( [ ] ) which would count all the numbers below the given number down to zero.




7. 

Sometimes when needing an array you need a very high number and not all the items in the array before that high number. So you would take the high, subtract the low then add 1. 
This method essentially makes the number you want to start from in the array, the start of the array.

It will output the i from Elaine.
